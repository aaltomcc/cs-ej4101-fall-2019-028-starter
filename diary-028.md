This Course
===========

Learned about FiTech somewhere early September 2019 and happily started to cherry-pick courses from various universities including Aalto.

While I've been professionally involved with software engineering for more than a quarter of a century I've seen the gradual change in the software realization process. I must admit Scrum made a bigger impact than any other system and not least because I was trained to the drill by people who participated writing Agile Manifesto and defining the Scrum process. Best of the breed.

DevOps I considerd to be a variation of agile and a gradual change from agile world into something more agile. Or maybe something that got formalized from the practises executed in wise organizations. To put it bluntly, I believe the management sales argument or the hidden agenda is to save and minimize the testing phase (and testing team especially) in the software process.

I admit my above mentioned viewpoint is not exactly complete and possibly somewhat pessimistic, too. So, as there was a course related to devOps in FiTech selection I happily enrolled.

I did not expect to see much new nor that the course would be too challenging to me. And I was right. Yet the amount of information and vast resources are surely something I value a lot. Of course I can git myself around but the amount of git wizardry available through the course material is impressive. Surely this is valuable.






So, simply put:
* prime oneself on tech issues and high-level theory related to devOps
* correct the vocabulary (to be able to communicate effectively with nerds)
* get in touch with resources that have the details unkown earlier
* deepen the insight
* do a nice exercise
* achieve an official approval / medal of your skills


Learned
=======


* That Aalto takes it easy with deadlined and project deliverables while imposing super-strict deadline policy on the students.
* Some deep git stuff (that I do not remember but I have a hint it exists)
* That the videos talk about waterfall style in such a way that it's value is not understood (V model is needed, guys, but not on your ecommerce site!)
