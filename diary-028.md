This Course
===========

<add the bigger motivation here later on>

So, simply put:
* prime oneself on tech issues and high-level theory related to devOps
* correct the vocabulary (to be able to communicate effectively with nerds)
* get in touch with resources that have the details unkown earlier
* deepen the insight
* do a nice exercise
* achieve an official approval / medal of your skills


Learned
=======

* That Aalto takes it easy with deadlined and project deliverables while imposing super-strict deadline policy on the students.
* Some deep git stuff (that I do not remember but I have a hint it exists
* That the videos talk about waterfall style in such a way that it's value is not understood (V model is needed, guys, but not on your ecommerce site!)
* see next
* did I just learn that starter website CI is not working? Trying to get it triggered thru merging this branch.
